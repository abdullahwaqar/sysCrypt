# sysCrypt
A simple, fully python ransomware proof of concept.
sysCrypt is a proof of concept ransomware which implements the PyCrypto module as a simple command and control server. It is a work in progress as of yet and i will be releasing updates periodically depending on a couple of factors.

Aside from very minor testing to ensure there are no syntax errors, no testing has been done. This may occur at a later time to ensure it performs in all expected environments,but that is not the point. The point is to be a simple to read proof of concept that makes for an easy example of what ransomware is and how it works.

**Warning: This project is young and incomplete. It will encrypt and decrypt files. That's about it. No key generation, no sending the key back over a secure channel. Pull requests are welcome.**
